Relationships can be full of playful dates, positive emotional growth, and a stream of sunsets and heart emojis. But unfortunately for many women, romantic relationships can also be major sources of negativity, stress and a never-ending stream of drama.Even worse, a lot of the signs of a toxic relationships are tricky to spot, so people in one might not even be aware of it. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to identify physical abuse but very difficult for a person in a toxic relationship to &#8216;hear&#8217; abuse, especially if the victim was raised around negativity or criticism,&#8221; says Aunt Mzansi.&#8220;For them, toxic relationships are a norm. Learning the verbal/behavioral signs of an abusive/narcissistic personality is a critical learning skill for everyone who dates. It&#8217;s an issue I work on in therapy with depressing regularity.&#8221;We asked experts to break down everyday relationship scenarios and tell us how they&#8217;re handled in a healthy relationship versus a toxic one. After all, identifying the problem is the first step toward doing something about it.1. How they act when they meet your familyHEALTHY:A partner in a healthy relationship will see this as the glorious opportunity it is: A chance to get in good with the (possibly) future in-laws. They will prep for it, like they would if they were going in for an interview at their dream job. They will pepper you with questions beforehand, hoping to gather as much intel as possible: What is your sister&#8217;s husband like? What kind of gift should they bring for your parents? Do your folks like chocolate or are they more wine people?&#8221;And when the day actually rolls around? &#8220;A healthy partner will be genuine, enthusiastic, and as interested in getting to know your loved ones as they were to get to know you. They will ask engaging questions, offer to help with the dishes, and treat you like the gem you are, reassuring your parents that you are in great hands.TOXIC:It may surprise you, but one of the best warning signs that you&#8217;re with a toxic partner is how they act the second you tell him or her you want everyone to meet long before the IRL moment occurs.A toxic partner is not worried about building a foundation with you and your kin. Instead of treating it like an opportunity or a symbol of trust, they will treat it like an unnecessary obligation.From the moment you utter the words &#8216;My family would love to meet you,&#8217; a toxic partner acts like you&#8217;ve just cordially invited him to a 24-hour shopping fest &#8230; on Black Friday &#8230; in a blizzard. They will take every chance they get to remind you what they&#8217;re giving up (&#8216;I guess I&#8217;ll tell the gang that they&#8217;ll be one short for poker night, but whatever!&#8217;), not to mention how much you owe them for their act of generosity.&#8220;A toxic lover takes zero interest in your family, choosing instead to spend the time on their phone, dozing off or complaining. They&#8217;ll answer your family&#8217;s questions with the enthusiasm of a fast food drive-thru worker, and ask no questions of their own. When the time comes to talk about you, they&#8217;ll do the opposite of building you up.Because nothing says &#8216;healthy relationship&#8217; like telling your parents the story of when you got too drunk at an office party and he had to carry you up two whole flights of stairs.&#8221; In short, they&#8217;ll make a time as exciting as meeting the fam (or the peeps you consider your family) as treacherous as possible.&nbsp;
