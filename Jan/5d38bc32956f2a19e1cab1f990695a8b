It is reported that the issue initially surfaced last year in October, only to die down the drain after intervention of close family relatives and church leaders.It is alleged that Bushiri had an affair with one Lindiwe Ntentesa from the beginning of last year. The wife is reported to have discovered the affair through frequent calls that were hitting Bushiri&#8217;s phone. He is also believed to have had an affair with another Maria Mkhabela who is pregnant. Bushiri is reported to have met these ladies when they used his hotel facilities. This latest scandal further adds to the controversies that has been rocking the charismatic preacher. He is also accused of embezzlement of funds for the church he promised to construct. The allegations could not be verified with Bushiri&#8217;s team as his spokesperson&#8217;s phone couldn&#8217;t go through
