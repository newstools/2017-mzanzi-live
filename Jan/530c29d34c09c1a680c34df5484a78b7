She was first given a kota (bunny chow) with poison &#8211; and when it took too long to kill her, she was strangled until she died, the court heard.Four men accused of kidnapping and murdering her appeared for a formal bail application in the Atteridgeville Magistrate&#8217;s Court yesterday.Investigating officer Lebogang Monareng told the court that John Lekubu, accused number one in the case, confessed to police how Keleabetse lost her life.Eyewitnesses also corroborated the details he gave, Monareng said.Lekubu allegedly admitted to luring Keleabetse to Brazzaville via Facebook under the pretext of being a &#8220;blesser&#8221;. Lekubu was also the first person to point out the pit latrine in which the body was dumped.&#8220;He indicated the deceased was given a [kota] with poison. He indicated she was crying, so they put a cloth [on her mouth],&#8221; Monareng told the court.&#8220;The poison took longer to kill her. So, accused number two [Tebogo Mabolane] took a rope and strangled her.&#8221;Keleabetse&#8217;s family members seated in the court&#8217;s public gallery cried out loud when Monareng described how she was killed. This forced magistrate S Hitchcock to adjourn the matter for a while.Monareng said though the DNA and postmortem reports were still outstanding, a pathologist indicated to him the &#8220;badly decomposed&#8221; body had deep cuts in the neck.Monareng told the court: &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced beyond doubt it is Seleka&#8217;s body that Lekubu pointed out in the toilet.&#8221;Lekubu, Mabolane and their co-accused Leshilo Mashau and Eugene Machete appeared in the dock handcuffed.Monareng told the court Keleabetse left home in Centurion on November 28 and said she was going to sleep over at a classmate&#8217;s place, also in Centurion. But she did not sleep there, and instead went to another classmate&#8217;s place in Atteridgeville.She did meet this classmate in Atteridgeville, but told her &#8220;she was going to meet a certain blesser in Brazzaville&#8221;, he said.But Keleabetse was robbed of her phone and assaulted and finally killed when she apparently refused to give the men her bank pin code, the court heard.She was killed on November 29 and her body was discovered on December 28.The four accused indicated to court they would plead not guilty.Mabolane and Mashau insisted in their affidavits they did not know why Lekubu implicated them in the matter.Their lawyer, Timothy Ramabulana, said his clients were not involved &#8220;in this heinous crime&#8221;.Monareng told the court there were two other men involved in Keleabetse&#8217;s killing. Police were yet to find and arrest them.He said there were witnesses who saw the entire incident. They only came out after the four were arrested. &#8220;They were told if they told police they would be killed as well.&#8221;Police pounced on Lekubu at 2am in the morning. They found him in bed with another young woman.Monareng said this woman told police Lekubu lured her on Facebook as well, promising to pay her R3000 after sex. He said it was possible that this woman would have been killed as well in the morning, instead of getting money.Outside court, Keleabetse&#8217;s family members refused to comment.The bail application was postponed to Wednesday next week.
