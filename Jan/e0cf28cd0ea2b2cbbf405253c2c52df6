President Jacob Zuma has been humiliated yet again by US President Elect Donald Trump. It is reported that he has been barred from attending Donald Trump s inauguration. We will not tolerate elements that are against democratic practices. South Africa has been burdened enough by the corruption perpetrated by Jacob Zuma. It is the time we start by setting the record straight, that we will not work with corrupt people, and people who stay in power against the will of people, Donald Trump told reporters in Iowa.He went on further to say that all corrupt leaders are not welcome to his inauguration. Zuma joins the likes of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and Gambia President Yahya Jammeh to the list of African leaders who will not be allowed to witness Trump taking oath.After Zuma became president, his private home at Nkandla in rural KwaZulu-Natal was substantially upgraded by the state. In November 2013 opposition parties accused Zuma of having used taxpayer funds not only for security improvements, but also private additions and improvements to his home. He was found guilty and was asked to pay the non-security upgrades done on his private property.RELATED: That s Madness, You don t kill workers, Xenophobia must be revisited Donald TrumpZuma&#8217;s close and allegedly corrupt relationship with the Gupta family has been a major source of discontent within both his own party the ANC and the South African public.
