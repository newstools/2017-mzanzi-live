Part of the discussions between Mamelodi Sundowns and City Football Group were to &#8220;park&#8221; Keagan Dolly in the short term, at one of the European Clubs that had a partnership with City Football Group.&#8220;We are disappointed and concerned by the continuous lies and misrepresentation which is spread by Paul Mitchell, Keagan Dolly&#8217;s agent, which makes any cooperation difficult. Mamelodi Sundowns does not want to be seen as a Club that can be blackmailed to sell players because of misrepresentations and pressure in the media.&#8220;Mamelodi Sundowns remains committed, as stated by its President Patrice Motsepe, to immediately release Keagan Dolly to any Club which comply&#8217;s with the buy-out clause which was upheld by the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber,&#8221; the statement concluded.Here follows the email from Manchester City:&#8220;Dear Patrice&#8216;On behalf of the City Football Group I am contacting you in respect of your player Keagan Dolly. We have been following the players (sic) performances for some time and believe he has the ability to play at a number of Clubs within the group.&#8216;If it is acceptable to both yourself and the player, we would like to invite you both to the City Football Academy at the earliest opportunity to discuss this matter further and meet key personnel within the Group.&#8216;I look forward to hearing from you regarding the above.&#8216;Kind regards&#8221;
