Without mentioning the teams, the 28-year-old has stated that he wouldn&#8217;t compromise his firm belief in God.Mabunda is just one of many players who believe in different things.Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo apparently won&#8217;t take to the field unless he&#8217;s had a fresh hair cut.Even more bizarre was former Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea, who believed that urinating on the field brought him luck during penalty shootouts.Mabunda says he even prays while a match is ongoing and now that his career is on the up, he believes &#8220;God has made good on His promise&#8221;.&#8220;Sometimes I pray even during the game, asking for strength from God,&#8221; the midfielder told the Sowetan from Rustenburg, where his team were in camp preparing for the second half of the season starting next month.A year ago, Mabunda had made just five appearances for Sundowns in close to three years and had even been loaned to Free State Stars.But since April last year, &#8220;Shuga&#8221; has become a regular feature for the Brazilians and believes it is the work of God at play.&#8220;I&#8217;ve been through many difficult things in my football career.&#8221; I never gave up because I believe that through what I do on the field and through the life that I live, it is the way for people being able to see the power of God.&#8221;Mabunda is a member of the Enlightened Christian Gathering, a church led by Malawian-born preacher Shepherd Bushiri.The former Black Leopards man often meets up with his Sundowns teammates goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands and defender Wayne Arendse for bible studies and prayer meetings.&#8220;It is never too late for somebody to change their ways and come back to God,&#8221; added the Bafana Bafana midfielder, who refers to his father as &#8220;teacher of the word.&#8221;
