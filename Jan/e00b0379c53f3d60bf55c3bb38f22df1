Cape Town President Jacob Zuma said on Friday that gospel star Lundi Tyamara, who was ill and died after a short stay in hospital, was one of the country&#8217;s best ever gospel artists.Aside from Zuma, political parties, including the EFF, Cope and IFP, sent condolences to the family of the star.Zuma said he was saddened that Tyamara, &#8220;a talented artist,&#8221; died at such a young age.&#8220;This is yet another huge loss for the country in a short space of time. He was one of the best gospel artists that the country has ever produced. We are with his family in thoughts and prayers during this trying period. May his soul rest in peace,&#8221; he said.The Mphefumlo wami singer was being treated for TB of the stomach and a liver condition.Gauteng Premier David Makhura said Tyamara had changed the sphere of the gospel industry with his first album.&#8220;Lundi s dedication and commitment to his craft saw him grow from humble beginnings into a household name in the gospel industry. On behalf of the people of Gauteng and the provincial government, I extend our condolences to the family, friends and the entire entertainment industry,&#8221; Makhura said.EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said Tyamara was one of them, and supported the EFF at a time when it was not fashionable to do so.&#8220;It is therefore not just an artist that has fallen, but a revolutionary who used his talent to awaken our people spiritually and to partake in a generational revolution of his time,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We therefore call on all artists to pick up his spear, firstly to emulate him in not only singing for some of their fans, but to sing to all, whatever party they may belong to. Secondly, like Lundi, to stand up for a generational course and revolution and never to betray the truth.&#8221;Lost a legendIFP national spokesperson Blessed Gwala said the South African music industry has lost a legend.&#8220;It s a moment of great sorrow to the family and the music industry, particularly, the gospel genre.
