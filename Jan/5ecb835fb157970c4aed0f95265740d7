It goes without saying that marriage takes work but what kind of work, exactly?We recently asked coupled-up relationship bloggers and MzansiLive readers to tell us what they do every single day to keep the spark alive. Here s what they said:1. They go in for a nice, long hug. When my husband gets home from work we hug for a good two to three minutes. It could be right when he walks in or after greeting our son and changing out of his suit. It ll happen whether we re upset with each other or not. &#8211; reader Karabo&nbsp;
