Johannesburg &#8211; The ANC planned to spend R50 million on a covert campaign targeting opposition parties in the 2016 local government elections, according to court papers filed in the High Court in Johannesburg.A covert team, initially known as the War Room, intended to disempower DA and EFF campaigns and set a pro-ANC agenda using a range of media, without revealing the ANC s hand.As traditional election campaigns lose their impact with voters, political parties are increasingly turning to more subtle methods, using everything from fake news to paid Twitter accounts to manipulate voter sentiment.For the War Room this included a seemingly independent news site and chat show, using influencers on social media, and planning to print fake opposition party posters.However, a scathing close-out report attached to the court application claims the initiatives were either short-lived or stillborn due to mismanagement and a lack of funding.The case was brought against the ANC by public relations expert Sihle Bolani, who claims she is owed R2.2 million for work done as part of the campaign. Bolani was a key member of the War Room.Bolani signed a R1 million settlement agreement with ANC general manager Ignatius Jacobs in early December, but is now demanding the full amount as she has still not been paid. The agreement, attached to the court papers, is on an ANC letterhead.Bolani wrote and submitted the close-out report to Jacobs and Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe in November. However, the ANC denies that the War Room existed. Your investigation has no basis and is based on malicious falsehoods and gossip, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told amaBhungane last week.The campaign that &#8216;never existed&#8217;Officially, there was supposed to be no link between the War Room and the ANC.The team, later known as the Media Advisory Team , would be led by activist Shaka Sisulu. ANC-linked businessman Joseph Nkadimeng was to source funds from private donors. The team was to operate from separate offices.In the close-out report, Bolani says Sisulu and Nkadimeng told team members during an inception meeting last April that the ANC has commissioned this project as part of the 2016 Municipal Elections .However, Sisulu made it very clear to her that she should not at any point, have direct contact with Luthuli House .The inception meeting was held last April at the Bryanston headquarters of advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which the ANC had contracted for its election campaign. Ogilvy appears not to have participated in the team s subsequent activities.In an interview with amaBhungane, Bolani described the campaign as effectively a propaganda machine . A lot of the work they needed us to do they didn&#8217;t want it to be branded ANC I think the intention with this vehicle was to do all the stuff that they can&#8217;t do as the ANC. So I think the directive from Ignatius [Jacobs] was go crazy just don&#8217;t link us [to it], Bolani said.&nbsp;
