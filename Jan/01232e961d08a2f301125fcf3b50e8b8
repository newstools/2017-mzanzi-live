&#8220;The award&#8217;s rules clearly state that in order to be nominated for an award, a song first has to be playlisted by the station and, secondly, be submitted for consideration. Mroza&#8217;s song has never been playlisted on the station and therefore was not considered for a nomination,&#8221; Kganyago told TshisaLIVE.When asked why Van Damme had not been play listed, Kganyago said that the license agreement prohibited this.He went on to shut down claims that Mroza was excluded on purpose.&#8220;Certain genres are not playlisted on the station. That is why we do not have a reggae or maskandi category at the awards. It is not about a certain song. We did not change the rules for a specific song. These rules have always been in place and we cannot change them.&#8221;
