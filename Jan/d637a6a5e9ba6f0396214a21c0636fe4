The animal appeared out of nowhere. Our guys were travelling at 100km per hour, even though they were responding to an emergency call. We know how notorious the Moloto Road can be and that is why were are extra careful when using that road. There are no signs on that road warning motorists about the animals so we couldn t have suspected something like this. Blake said the driver of the ambulance, Liver Maile, broke his legs and was in a critical condition in hospital.His colleague, who was sitting in the passenger seat was transported to Mamelodi Hospital after sustaining moderate injuries while the third medic, who was in the back of the ambulance escaped injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;
