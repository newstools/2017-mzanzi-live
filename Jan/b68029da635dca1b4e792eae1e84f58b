The 26-year-old Venezuela-born player has been on trial at Amakhosi, and according to The Sowetan, he has done enough to secure a contract with the club.Paez, together with Brazilian defender Pedro DeAmorim, Miracle Gabeya from Malawi and Ivory Coast s Olivier Toure, started training with Chiefs at the beginning of the month.Gabeya and Toure, however, were released after failing to impress.Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung confirmed to the newspaper that they have signed one player, but could not say whether or not that player was Paez. We have signed one, and we will make other announcements. [The new signing] is from outside [the country], said Motaung.Paez s arrival will apparently allow the club to release strikers Edward Manqele and Siphelele Mthembu.
