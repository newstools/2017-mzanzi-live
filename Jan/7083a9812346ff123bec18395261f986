While Molefe resigned disgracefully from Eskom, after he was placed at the Gupta s Saxonwold homestead by public protector Thuli Madonsela s state capture report last year he is apparently set to become the new minister of finance.Sunday Times reports that the North West ANC has sent a request for Molefe to be included as an MP. This will effectively prepare Molefe for a cabinet position and insiders have told the weekly that president Jacob Zuma wants to replace Pravin Gordhan with Molefe.Molefe s promotion is due to take place after the state of the nation address on February 9, when Zuma is expected to announce a cabinet reshuffle. AU chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is also set to be accommodated in Zuma s cabinet, paving the way for her to officially be elected as a successor to Zuma.Molefe s appointment is said to have reached Luthuli House and is being handled by the ANC s top officials. From time to time we review lists and asses our strenghts and weaknesses. Brian is a citizen of this country and a resident of our province. Him having announced his exit from Eskom and so excellently executed his mandate, we are of the view that he, and other cadres we are engaging, can contribute immensely to the strengthening and deepening of democracy in our province, said North West provincial secretary Dakota Legoete.Molefe also has the backing of the ANCYL, with the president Collen Maine calling him an example of black excellence. An ANC leader has confirmed Molefe s redeployment, adding that his skills and leadership were needed in parliament. We always complain that MPs don t have capacity; he has capacity. We need him, the source said.
