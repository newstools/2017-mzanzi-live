Valencia Slava spent almost three hours fighting for her life on a street in Soweto after being stabbed four times allegedly by a 22-year-old woman and her mother.Earlier on Saturday afternoon, the 16-year-old, pictured, had ironed three dresses in preparation for the next day&#8217;s service and Sunday school at the Twelve Apostles&#8217; Church, a stone&#8217;s throw from Ballenden Street in Noordgesig where she was stabbed, her mother Mpumi Slava said.&#8220;She ironed the three dresses, telling me she wasn&#8217;t sure how the weather would be so she had to be prepared,&#8221; Mpumi recalled of the moments before her daughter was stabbed.She said Valencia left home that afternoon after supper, after being called by her friends.Older sister Portia said she got a call around 9pm on Saturday informing her that Valencia had been stabbed.Witnesses told Portia and Mpumi that Valencia was fighting with the 22-year-old when her mother suddenly appeared and allegedly stabbed her in the back of her left shoulder.&#8220;Her mother then gave the knife to her daughter, who then stabbed Valencia once above her right breast and twice below it,&#8221; Portia said.The reason for the fight was still unclear although Mpumi said the 22-year-old had previously fought with one of Valencia&#8217;s friends.Ballenden Street residents told the Slavas the incident had happened around 6pm and that a concerned neighbour took Valencia to Helen Joseph Hospital because the ambulance took too long to arrive.&#8220;It only arrived when we were already in hospital,&#8221; Mpumi said.Although Valencia had undergone an operation and was admitted to the intensive care unit, she was able to talk to her mother on Sunday and appeared to be getting better.&#8220;She even told her friends to bring her books to hospital so that she is not left behind in her school work,&#8221; Mpumi said.She was shocked by Portia&#8217;s piercing screams on Monday morning while preparing to visit Valencia in hospital.Portia had just got off the phone with the hospital, which had informed her of her sister&#8217;s death.&#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t believe it when she shouted &#8216;she&#8217;s gone!'&#8221;The mother of the 22-year-old was arrested on Sunday while her daughter was arrested yesterday.&#8220;I want to see this girl who killed my daughter,&#8221; said a tearful Mpumi.Valencia, a bright Grade 11 pupil at Noordgesig Secondary School, was always busy with her school books, according to her mother, and sang in the church choir.Mpumi said Valencia wanted to be a doctor and conduct postmortems on the dead.Yesterday, the family was preparing for her funeral, which they wanted to be held this Saturday, but the hospital mortuary informed Mpumi that her daughter&#8217;s body would not be released without a postmortem having been conducted.Police spokeswoman Constable Monica Hangwani said the suspects were denied bail by the Orlando Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Tuesday.They each face a charge of murder.Hangwani said police had no information on the relationship between the suspects.She said they did not know what the motive for the stabbing was.
