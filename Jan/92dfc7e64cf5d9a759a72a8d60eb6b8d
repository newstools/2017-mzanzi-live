When I got closer, I could could see that Thabani was having intercourse with a goat, His pants were down to his ankles and the goat was in his lap trying to get away. The mortified witness got out of his truck and tried to put a stop to it, a witness said. The man&#8230; tried to disengage from the act, but was essentially stuck in the goat, she said.
