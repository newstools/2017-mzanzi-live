The pair, who have been slinging mud at each other on social media, were involved in a heated feud that saw Cruz drop a diss track on Friday.Cruz apparently received a threatening voicemail from Emtee after releasing the track, and so decided to open a case of intimidation against Emtee. Emtee responded with a counter case of intimidation against Cruz.&#8220;I can confirm that Tshepo Modise (Cruz Afrika) opened a case of intimidation against party Mthembeni Ndevu (Emtee) over the weekend. Mr Ndevu then laid a counterclaim against Mr Modise for intimidation. The matter is currently under police investigation,&#8221; Edenvale police spokesperson Captain Jean Olckers said.A series of tweets on Emtee&#8217;s Twitter account seemed to confirm that Cruz had called the cops on him.&#8220;How do you start beef with me, include my son in your wack raps then call the cops after telling you Uzonya (you piece of sh*t),&#8221; read one of the tweets that has since been deleted.Emtee has remained defiant in the face of the drama, telling MzansiLive that he is not scared of any legal action that he might face.&#8220;I&#8217;m not really in a position to talk about this, it is a matter for my lawyers. But I&#8217;m cool. I don&#8217;t think I did anything wrong. I am not scared. Cruz always does this with other musicians. I really think this will pass,&#8221; Emtee said.The rapper referred us to his management who refused to comment on the matter.
