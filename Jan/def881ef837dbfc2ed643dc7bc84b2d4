My husband is always accusing me of cheating.He even gets angry and violent. We are both working but throughout the years I have done more financially between us including buying our home, furniture and taking care of our children. I thought he would appreciate it instead he says other men are supporting me. I am frustrated, I don&#8217;t know what to do?&nbsp;
