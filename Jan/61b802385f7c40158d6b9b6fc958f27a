Johannesburg Supporting Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to become South Africa s Public Protector was a terrible mistake, EFF leader Julius Malema has said.&#8220;We just took a puppet from Gupta s kitchen and said let s give her a chance,&#8221; he explained during a media conference on MondayThe EFF threw its weight behind Mkhwebane during a parliamentary process to replace former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela in 2016. It opted to ignore claims from some, including those from the DA, that Mkhwebane was a spy. The EFF, however, did say it would take her appointment on review if it felt she was not in the position for the right reasons.During a media briefing at the EFF s headquarters on Monday, Malema shook his head as he expressed his disappointment and lack of confidence in Mkhwebane s ability to fulfil her role.&#8220;We are looking at some way of rescuing that office,&#8221; said Malema. He admitted that the EFF had already started looking at ways to have Mkwehbane removed.His comments also come amidst claims that Mkhwebane tampered with a report into Absa bank, over a complaint that it benefited from an apartheid-era bail out.Political parties also questioned Mkhwebane s decision not to oppose an application by President Jacob Zuma and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des Van Rooyen in October 2016 to obtain an interdict against the Madonsela&#8217;s State of Capture report.&#8220;We must stop calling her the public protector and start calling her a state protector,&#8221; Malema said.
