The Finance Minister says the Gupta family cannot have asked him for help and then accuse him of running a campaign to close them down.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says in legal papers that it makes no sense for the Gupta family to accuse him of telling other business leaders to help close down their firms because they actually asked him for help when the big banks closed their accounts.He has now replied to claims made by the Gupta-owned companies as part of an application that he has brought asking a judge to say that it would be illegal for him to order the banks to keep those accounts open.In the documents Gordhan says the Gupta family cannot have asked him for help and then accused him of running a campaign to close them down.Gordhan says it doesn t make sense for the family to first ask him for help by submitting a request for him to intervene with the banks and for them to then claim that he was actually responsible for getting the banks to close the accounts in the first place.Gordhan also says that he s surprised to read for the first time in Oakbay s legal papers of a dispute between himself and the Gupta family which has a long and unfortunate political history .He says there is no hint of this in any of the letters which the Guptas sent him asking for his help.Gordhan also says the source of their claim that he asked business leaders to help him shut down the Gupta firms is not named, that the number of sources is not given and that it s not explained how the Gupta family could know this &nbsp;
