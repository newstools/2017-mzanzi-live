I discovered three years ago that I am HIV positive, my husband is now distant and cold. He calls me names, says my body looks shapeless and does not enjoy se.x with me, but he refuses to leave me.He still wants se.x with me anyway. I thought he will change in time. I am confused.AuntMzansi replies: This is what emotional and psychological abuse looks like. Someone degrading you all the time. Then making you feel like they are the only people who can love you and no one out there can love you.You hear this for so long, you start to believe it. He still sleeps with you because he can see that you are insecure and not able to stand up for yourself. Love is supposed to protect and build you as a person, not destroy you. This is not a healthy relationship anymore. It&#8217;s clear he has a problem that he&#8217;s taking out on you. Both of you need help.DrLove replies: I&#8217;m picking up two problems here. Your HIV status and a disenchanted, abusive husband. Choose which problem you want to deal with first and vigilantly.Should you choose to deal with your HIV problem &#8211; get rid of this man. He will stress you and lead you to depression.At this point in your life you need support not abuse. Put yourself first and love yourself selfishly and unconditionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;
