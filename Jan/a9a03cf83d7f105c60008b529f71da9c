The best indicator that a woman you ve just met is into you? Proximity.I teach my clients the Arm, Elbow, Shoulder strategy: When the two of you are at arm s length from each other, it usually means the conversation s more social and superficial. If interest increases, you ll naturally get closer, about an elbow s length away. And If you start feeling even more intimate, you ll likely be almost touching shoulders.Another great way to gauge interest: Mix playful banter complimenting her personality, teasing her playfully with physical contact, like touching her elbow when emphasizing points. If she s not returning the banter and touching you back, she may not see you as a mate. If she is, you re probably in good shape to get that date!
