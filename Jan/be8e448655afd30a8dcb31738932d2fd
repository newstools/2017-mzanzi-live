More often than not, full-grown adults turn into teenagers when it comes to finding out if someone likes them. They ll get friends to bring it up, they ll go out in group settings, or use flirty texts, but in a joking way, just to get away without being obvious.It s time for everyone to grow up. The truth is that finding out if someone likes you is pretty straightforward. You don t have to ask at all, you can just tell. Hiding your attraction for someone is pretty much impossible, because even if you don t say much of anything, other signs will. The things you do and say around the person will be done in careful consideration of their presence, even subconsciously.15 signs people give away when they like someoneSo how can you tell if someone likes you? Well, you just have to watch out for a few of these signs.#1 Attraction. Even in a group setting, they ll gravitate toward you. Think of it this way: when you go out and there s a mixture of people present, you end up hanging out with people you already know and like, or with new people that you re starting to befriend. The same goes for attraction. You re going to want to gravitate toward that person, because you want to spend time with them.#2 Nervousness. When they talk to you, they may seem shy, or awkward. This is not always the case, but if the person gets shy around you, then it means you make them nervous, in a good way.They may be trying too hard not to mess anything up, or they may be wondering what to say, to get the conversation going because they want to leave a lasting impression on you.&nbsp;
