President Robert Mugabe has made revelations that has startled South Africa. In an attack aimed at EFF Leader Julius Malema, Mugabe has revealed that Madiba once warned him about putting Malema close to him.This comes as Malema chided Mugabe for staying in power in Zimbabwe. During the press briefing, Malema waded into Mugabe and the African Union. Zimbabwe s situation is bad. President Mugabe can t even control a spade. He is no longer capable of discharging his responsibilities, Malema said.Mugabe has refused to be outmatched in the war of words. &#8220;I was with Nelson Mandela during the struggle for independence. He was my friend. After Malema came into the scene, he even told me that the boy could not be trusted. He is stupid. We discussed the future of ANC and Zanu PF and Madiba told me that South Africa was going to resist Julius Malema, which will make it difficult for him to be a President like us one day. It is at that point that Mandela asked me to nurture Malema into a revolutionary, but the boy is stubborn and stupid, he cannot learn. He thinks he knows everything,&#8221; Mugabe saidMugabe&#8217;s response has been met with mixed feelings, some saying he is trying to find a way of making people focus away from the fact that he overstaying in power.&nbsp;
