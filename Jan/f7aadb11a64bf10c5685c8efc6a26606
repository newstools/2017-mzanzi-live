A Capetown man Michael Theron who married a Newcastle born and breed Zulu woman a few years ago opens up about the trials and tribulations in their marital journey.&#8220;When i met Nomkhosi at Fort Hare University i fell in love with her on the first sight, i knew what i wanted and she was the complete package that complements my life. It wasn&#8217;t easy getting her attention, friendships and relationships across racial lines were the most condemned than taking drugs.Honestly i had to bribe this other Vusi guy so that he would talk good about me when he is around Nom. My efforts never went unnoticed as she managed to give me a chance in her life and from that day i am crushing on her everyday, she is the queen of my heart, there is nothing that beats love of a Zulu woman&#8221; he said.RELATED: They are black but they are mine: Cape Town man whose wife gave birth to black twinsMichael reveals that it wasn&#8217;t easy for Nom to blend into the Theron family but she managed despite all family resistance.&#8221; Honestly my family couldn&#8217;t withstand the &#8220;disgrace&#8221; as they called it but when they saw disgrace in Nom , i saw a &#8216;blessing&#8217;. I remember when my mom told her never to show her black face again in their house, she was really heart broken but i kept insisting that my parents will come around and accept her. We moved to Pretoria for 2years and on my birthday my mother called me and asked to bring Nom when i visit.RELATED: Tembisa man burns himself after wife gives birth to Chinese twinsAfter receiving parental blessings i married her and we were blessed two kids, I love Nom so much because she understands, tolerate and accept our racial differences also she teaches me isiZulu.
