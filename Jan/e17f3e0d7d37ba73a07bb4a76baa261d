When I think of shower, I picture my friend who, sudsed-up and raring to go, tumbled out of the tub onto cold, hard tile. Now that we&#8217;re done giggling at fun gone wrong, let&#8217;s talk about how you can do shower well. All it takes is the right position and I&#8217;ve got four. Position: The Leg LiftHow to do it:__You lean back against the shower wall and have your guy stand front of you. Then, wrap one leg around his waist or ask him to hold the back of your knee in the crook of his elbow to make this move a little easier on you.Why it works: You&#8217;ve got support in two places the wall and his strong arms so a tumble out of the tub is unlikely. Plus, this position allows you to have s_ex face-to-face, which is nice because it&#8217;s so intimate.Position: Standing DogieHow to do it: Put your palms against the shower wall, leaning toward it at a 45-degree angle with your knees slightly bent for comfort. Your partner can then enter you from behind.Why it works: This is the go-to shower s_ex position for a reason you&#8217;re secure between the wall and your partner, who surely appreciates the view.Position: Sit and SlideHow to do it: Have him take a seat with his butt on the tub&#8217;s base and his legs stretched out, then straddle him for any version of woman on top that you prefer.Why it works: Woman_on_top lets you control the pace and intensity. Bonus: The water hitting your back will keep you nice and warm.Position: I Could Shave But Let&#8217;s Have S_ex Instead (and yes, I totally made that name up)How to do it: Place your foot on the edge of the tub, just as you would if you had your razor in hand. But instead of shaving, let him enter you from the front or back, depending on what makes you most comfortable.Why it works: Admittedly, this position comes with the most risk a wet foot placed on the edge of a slippery tub could send you flying out of said tub so proceed with extreme caution and dry feet. But done right, I&#8217;m told this angle feels divine.&nbsp;
