I m 37 and in a relationship. He works but always says he doesn t have money even though he s not married.I used to help him with cash but now I think he s using me. I know I love him, but now our relationship has come to an end.It seems I m begging him when it comes to my money. I m so tired.Please advise.Aunt Mzansi answers The moment you agreed to be his piggy bank, you made him financially dependent on you, and he has taken advantage of that.Maybe you should have helped him to deal with his finances effectively or budget instead.Sit down and talk to him about this and offer to assist him with managing his finances.RELATED: Aunt Mzansi: Is it possible to be in a relationship without a car?If he s unwilling to try, then perhaps it s time for you to move on, because you have indicated that the relationship seems to have reached its sell-by date.Just don t allow him to use and abuse you.
