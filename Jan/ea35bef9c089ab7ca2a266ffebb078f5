But let me tell you, the funny part of that story; he disappeared from us.&#8221;&#8220;We went to scout him in Togo when Ivory Coast was playing against Togo in the finals,&#8221; the experienced coach continued.&#8220;We scouted him and made arrangements that he should come and expected him when we started (training) on the 18th (of January).&#8221;RELATED: Kaizer Chiefs sign Italian striker&#8220;This part has never been told by anybody, I am telling you. You hear me on record; he disappeared from us,&#8221; he added.&#8220;I waited for him to come on the 18th and guess what happened? He pitched. Where was he before? I really don t want to know, I am not interested to know.&#8221;&#8220;All I have to do is to support my scouting team because they scouted him and recommended him and to come and see him,&#8221; Mosimane stressed.&#8220;He came at the right time and the right time was to come to Rustenburg. So he came, everything was in time, everything was properly set. Where was he before? I don t want to know, he concluded.
