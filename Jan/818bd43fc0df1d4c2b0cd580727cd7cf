Msawawa, whose real name is Siboniso Dlamini, did not walk down the aisle with his KwaZulu- Natal-based businesswoman Angela Gwala in December as previously planned.It&#8217;s not yet clear why the star and his girlfriend called things off, but Msawawa has moved out of Gwala&#8217;s posh Richards Bay home which is situated by the beach, back to his hometown in Claremont, Durban, where he lives with his father.Two sources close to the couple have revealed that the pair broke things off in December before the musician&#8217;s wealthy sugar mama gave him marching orders.&#8220;I was with him in December and he didn&#8217;t want to talk about his wedding. He broke up with his woman and no one is saying anything about the wedding they promised us in December,&#8221; one source said.A friend of Gwala said the businesswoman was not sure if she should go ahead with the wedding. &#8220;She is not sure whether to marry him or not. She says that he is not stable and that his eyes are all over the place.&#8220;They are currently not together as she says they are on what we call a break. She is trying to see if he will change,&#8221; the source said.When approached for comment, Gwala declined to speak, asking that questions be sent to her via SMS. She had not responded to them by the time of going to print.The pair hogged headlines in 2015 when it emerged that the musician, who was aged 25 at the time, had paid lobola for his sugar mama &#8211; who is over 10 years older than him. He told Sowetan at the time that he had plans of walking down the aisle with his sweetheart before the end of the year.But now when contacted Msawawa, he replied: &#8220;I am busy with other things now and I don&#8217;t want to talk about my private life anymore.&#8220;All my conversations should be about my work only. I will get married and you guys will only see that I am married without a lot of noise about it,&#8221; he said.
