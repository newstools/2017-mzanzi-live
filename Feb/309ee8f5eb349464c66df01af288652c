AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is a syndrome caused by a virus called HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). The illness alters the immune system, making people much more vulnerable to infections and diseases. This susceptibility worsens as the syndrome progresses.HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person (semen and vaginal fluids, blood and breast milk). The virus is passed from one person to another through blood-to-blood and sexual contact.These are some of the indications and signs that can occur with HIV infection:SORE THROATThis may be an early symptom of HIV infection as the body reacts to the viral infection. Also, it can happen later in the disease because the immune system of the infected individuals becomes compromised. Sore throat can be triggered by thrush in the mouth or esophagus, and ulcers. Check with your doctor if you are having chronic throat problems.SAD STORY: Video: HIV Positive house maid records sex tape with her boss 14 year old son to fix her HEADACHESUnrelenting headaches are one of the first symptoms of the flu related symptoms of HIV.
