When talking about prevention of cancer, routine tests are not sufficient if you want to be on the safe side. What s important is to listen to your body and notice when something s different, unexplainable, and odd. Therefore, take a look at some of these symptoms that are commonly overlooked:Shortness of breath or wheezingAccording to lung cancer patients, one of the first signs they remember noticing is the inability to catch their breath.Chest ache and chronic coughLeukemia and lung cancers can cause symptoms like coughing and bronchitis. Moreover, chest pain that extends up into the shoulder or down the arm could also be a sign of lung cancer.&nbsp;Frequent fevers and infectionsThese signs could point out to leukemia, cancer of the blood cells which begins in the bone marrow. Hence, leukemia causes abnormal production of white blood cells, thus decreasing the body s ability to fight off infections.Difficulty swallowingProblems with swallowing are often associated with esophageal, throat, and lung cancer.Excessive bruising and bleeding which doesn t stopThese symptoms show that there is something abnormal happening with the platelets and red blood cells, which could be an indicator of leukemia.
