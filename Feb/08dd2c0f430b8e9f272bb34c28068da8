Ntsiki has never been one to hold her tongue when something is bothering her, and after learning of the resignation of Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu on Wednesday, she took to Twitter to question how ministers could lead portfolios that they were not qualified in.Mahlangu&#8217;s resignation came amidst a health ombudsman&#8217;s ruling that she had been &#8220;reckless&#8221; in moving patients from professional health care facilities to unregistered NGOs which were found to be unsafe crowded and without sufficient heating.Ntsiki&#8217;s rant against government ministers quickly focused on Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa.But guys kunini sibuza ukuthi how can someone unqualified lead an industry. &#8230;.Nathi Mthethwa included ? He is not an artist&mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) February 1, 2017Ntsiki went on to claim that her education and experience made her more qualified for the job.Guys&#8230;.can we discuss what qualifications ministers have pls? &mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) February 2, 2017I am more qualified to be minister of arts n culture than Nathi Mthethwa. &#8230;and by far. My experience and qualifications say so&#8230;.&mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) February 1, 2017I have a MA in the arts and over fifteen years work experience&#8230;..what does Nathi Mthethwa have? Except an anc badge &mdash; Imbongikazi yeSizwe (@ntsikimazwai) February 1, 2017Her comments sparked sharp debate between herself and her followers, and later led to Ntsiki reaffirming her previous position.Mthethwa has yet to respond.&nbsp;
