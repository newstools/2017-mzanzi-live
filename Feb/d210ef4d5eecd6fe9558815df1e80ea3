Kick your pleasure into overdrive with a few small tweaks.If you learned a killer new workout that made your body feel incredible, you d likely share it with your friends. But when it comes to it, men aren t as likely to trade tips. And that s a shame. So we ll get the sharing party started: After chatting with sexologists and pouring over the latest, hottest research, we found these eight ways to take your orga.sm to the next level.1.

It s the stretch of skin between your balls and your butt, and it s a one-way ticket to Pleasuretown. This area is packed with nerve-endings, so it feels really sensitive, says Dr Arlene Goldman, coauthor of Secrets of Sexual Ecstasy.Some guys say that by applying pressure to this area, they re able to have multiple orga.sms &#8211; which is probably because you can stimulate your prostate gland externally via your perineum. During intercourse or oral, ask your partner to place a finger here and press onto it until the pressure feels just right.&nbsp;
