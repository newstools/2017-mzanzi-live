In a well calculated criminal incident, a Pretoria man faked illness to enable him to have intercourse with a nurse (name withheld) at Mediclinic Muelmed Hospital.It is reported that the middle aged man, who used the name Mashudu Madela told his brother that he had a stomach bug.His brother organised transport for him and left him admitted at Mediclinic Muelmed Hospital. Around the late hours of Tuesday, Madela is reported to have raped the Nurse-On-Duty twice. The matter came to light in the morning when the nurse reported the matter to management leading to Madela&#8217;s arrest.Further examinations on Madela revealed that he did not have a stomach bug, and could have possibly faked illness to commit a crime. Madela had been at the hospital some time in 2016, and could have spotted his victim. He was also found with pictures of the nurse in his phone gallery.He will appear in court on 4 February 2017.
