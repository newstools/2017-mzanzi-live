Let me start this article off by telling you that all women are different and what they expect from a man will be different.Most women want to date men but for some reason, ironically, end up dating boys. It s not your physical appearance, money or age that makes you a man.I personally wanted a boy in my life not a man; I ended up dating and falling in love with a boy. Dealing with a boy wasn t easy; when he finally transitioned, I noticed that he turned out to become a man who was way manlier than many men I have known.My bad boy grew up with me, and I am proud of the gentleman he has become. Many of you might not agree with me but for me the criterion which differentiates boys from men is completely different. I don t believe in the Men will be men and Boys will be Boys BS.Remember, boys grow up to become men, some grow up young and others never will and that s okay, there are people who love them for who they are.Just try this one thing next time you want to date a guy, try to know him as a friend, you won t be friend zoned, I am married to my best friend.Don t be like, ooh that guy is hot, I so want to be his girlfriend . For all you know, he might turn out to be the biggest jerk you have ever known. Here is my definition of what a man should be like.Every relationship has issues, but they cannot be dealt with if he doesn t listen. A man is willing to listen no matter how harsh the criticism might be, he might not agree with you, but he will listen.Any boy who loves his woman will man up enough to at least hear his girl out.If he is incapable of doing so, your relationship might not go a long way! He might have a million flaws but if he listens and tries to correct his ways to put a smile on your face, you have a man on your hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;
