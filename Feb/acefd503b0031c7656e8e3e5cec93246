National chairperson of the EFF, Dali Mpofu flew to Lundi Tyamara s funeral to speak but was told at the last minute that he could not do so.According to Sunday World, relatives of Lundi blocked Mpofu after they had a meeting on who could speak at the funeral service. Eff spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said he was shocked to learn that Mpofu was prohibited from addressing funeral goers. We all know Lundi was ill-treated by the ruling party and government by associating himself with us. We wanted to deliver words of condolences, not because he was an EFF supporter but because he was a national asset, said Ndlozi.Lundi s brother, Siya said Mpofu was prevented from speaking because he was not invited.Anele Hlazo, who managed Lundi, apologised for the way Mpofu was treated. I was shocked when Mpofu was prevented from speaking whereas an ANC councillor, DA MEC and a national minister were allowed to speak. I fought for Mpofu to speak but I was defeated by other committee members. I feel like I failed the EFF and sincerely apologise, said Hlazo.&nbsp;
