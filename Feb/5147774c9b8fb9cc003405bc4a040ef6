A South African Police Service (SAPS) officer has been highly criticised for his inappropriate behaviour after a video of him fighting with a man recently surfaced.The video, which was posted on Facebook page South-Africa Uncensored on Wednesday morning, shows the cop throwing a few punches at the other man, who ducks while trying to get away.An armed cop in uniform fighting a citizen may be bad enough, but what has caused outrage is that he appears to be drunk, and the video seems to have been taken in the morning.RELATED: Watch: A racist got more than what he bargained for after attacking a black petrol attendantSome have come to his defence, saying the two men were just playing around and that the officer was not drunk, judging by what one of the spectators in the video said. Badlala kabi [they re playing rough], he shouted.However, those who condemned his actions pointed out the two men may have been playing around, but the cop was drunk, as he flipped over while trying to slap the other man in the first few seconds of the video.Drunk or not, fellow cop Mandla Ngubane, who commented on the video, condemned his colleague s actions and said it was a mystery to him why cops like him still existed in the force. That s when I feel embarrassed to be a policeman. My pride goes out, through the window. I just don t know why do we have such policemen! But at least there are some of us who still have it within themselves. I am a policeman who is much better than this and there colleagues of mine out there who are better police officials then this, he said.Watch the video below:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
