Cyclone refers to any spinning storm that rotates around a low-pressure center. The low-pressure center is also referred to as the &#8216;eye&#8217; of the storm, which is well known for being eerily calm compared with the areas under the spinning &#8216;arms&#8217; of the storm. tropical cyclones are cyclones that occur over tropical ocean regions.Along with powerful winds, tropical cyclones can bring heavy rain and storm surge creating life threatening situations in addition to the cyclone itself. Heavy rainfall can cause flooding.Category 1 &#8211; A category one cyclone has estimated wind gusts up to 125 kilometers per hour. These wind speeds can damage crops, blow over small unsecured objects and cause boats to drag their moorings.Category 2 &#8211; A category two cyclone has estimated wind gusts of between 125 and 164 kilometers per hour. These wind speeds will cause damage to homes, blow over large trees and make it dangerous to be outside.Category 3 &#8211; A category three cyclone has estimated wind gusts of between 165 and 224 kilometers per hour. These destructive wind gusts can rip roofing from buildings, destroy caravans, cause large debris to fly through the air and the risk of injury is real. If a cyclone reaches a category 3 intensity, it is referred to as a severe tropical cyclone and is often the point where the characteristic eye of the cyclone will become clear on satellite images.Category 4 &#8211; A category four cyclone has estimated wind gusts of between 225 and 279 kilometers per hour. These winds are very destructive, causing significant roofing and structural damage to buildings, dangerous airborne debris and widespread power failures.Category 5 &#8211; A category five cyclone has estimated wind gusts of between 280 kilometers per hour and above.
