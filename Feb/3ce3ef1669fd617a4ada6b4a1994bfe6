Parents of pupils at Aurora Girls High School are baying for the blood of the school headmaster, Mr Teboho Raseala whom they accuse of using black magic on teachers and pupils, a development which has seen 13 teachers fleeing the institution while parents are threatening to withdraw their children. The headmaster has, however, since denied the accusations. Black magic, metaphorically called bluetooth sex is a kind of black magic whereby a man can supposedly have sex with a woman from a distance and without her consent. The development at the school follows a series of mass hysteria that has intermittently hit the learning institution since the beginning of the year with more than 20 pupils claiming to be having supernatural experiences where they allegedly see Mr Raseala in their illusions calling them.Another wave of hysteria gripped scores of female pupils at Aurora Girls High School two weeks ago who simultaneously started speaking in alien language while allegedly calling the headmaster s name alleging that he was calling them.A few days later, another mass hysteria hit the school and started spreading to teachers with some claiming that they had supernatural experiences while some alleged that they felt like they were having sex. This raised suspicion that there could be someone using black magic on the pupils since the hysteria was only affecting females while some suspected acts of satanism.A police source alleged that some of the children started having the same experiences while at home where they would act weird claiming that they were seeing the headmaster, Mr Raseala in their illusions. The matter although it is not of police interests since allegations of witchcraft are intricate and the law does not give a provision for police to investigate witchcraft, the community is suspecting that the headmaster is using black magic on school pupils and that he could be involved in satanism since most children were having supernatural experiences where he would appear in the pupils illusions.Parents went and demonstrated at the school and education offices demanding the transfer of the headmaster while some teachers are said to have fled the school since the hysteric attacks, said the police source.A teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity said about 20 children were hit by hysteria at one go prompting parents and other people in nearby communities to besiege the school armed with machetes accusing the headmaster of using black magic on their children and also attempting to initiate them into Satanism.
