Themba Zwane came off the bench to help the Tshwane giants beat Phunya Sele Sele 1-0 in front of their home fans in Bloemfontein on Wednesday nightMamelodi Sundowns hit the ground running in their first match of 2017, edging out Bloemfontein Celtic to keep their title dreams alive.Pitso Mosimane&#8217;s charges knew the importance of this encounter, especially if they are to defending their league title come June this year.The win took the Brazilians to fifth on the log with 22 points from 10 league games.Keagan Dolly&#8217;s departure to French Ligue 1 side Montpellier dominated headlines throughout the January transfer window, and all eyes were on Mosimane to see how he would cope without the nippy left-footed player.The 52-year-old mentor went for the tried and tested, fielding Anthony Laffor and Sibusiso Vilakazi alongside Khama Billiat and Percy Tau as his attacking quartet. He also rested a few of his regulars, and handed new signing Fares Hachi his PSL debut.Like his opposite number, Celtic interim coach Lehlohonolo Seema didn&#8217;t do much tweaking to his usual starting line-up, although Lantshene Phalane was a notable absentee on the night.Tignyemb and Sandilands were the reason both sides went into the half-time break locked at 0-0.Patrick Tignyemb brought his A-game as he denied Sundowns skipper Hlompho Kekana on two separate occasions in the first half. The Cameroonian keeper had his body behind the ball as Kekana unleashed from distance in the 13th minute.The Phunya Sele Sele shot-stopper was again equal to the task as he parried Kekana&#8217;s second attempt at goal in the 34th minute.At this stage, Sundowns were all over their Bloemfontein opponents.However, they were lucky not go into the interval at least 1-0 down as Thapelo Morena cleared Celtic&#8217;s attempt off the line toward the end of the first half, before Wayne Sandilands, in for Denis Onyango, kept his side in the game with a fine save on the stroke of half time.Goalscoring chances were few and far between in the second half, but Celtic will have Tignyemb to thank for keeping Sundowns at bay for the better part of the game.Mosimane changed his tactics soon after introducing Themba Zwane in the 63rd minute, opting for pace in wide areas, while relying on Kekana&#8217;s strength and Lucky Mohomi&#8217;s creativity in the middle of the park.The move paid off with 12 minutes to go, as the speedy winger and Leonardo Castro combined inside the Celtic box. Zwane received a well-weighted pass from the South American striker inside the penalty area, dribbled past two defenders before firing past Tignyemb to make it 1-0.Tau saw his attempt hit the crossbar in the 83rd minute as Sundowns looked to put the game to bed.The visitors nearly paid the price for missing that opportnity, and three minutes later, Zwane provided a defensive magic, clearing the ball off the line much to the frustration of Seema on the Celtic bench.
