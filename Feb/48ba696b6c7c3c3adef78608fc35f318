Whether you ve just completed a gruelling workout or chowed down on an onion-packed burger, chances are, at one time or another, you ve been that guy who stunk up the room.In most cases, a simple shower, swipe of deodorant or line of minty-fresh toothpaste could remedy the situation. But in other cases, it s not so simple.That s because your body odour can actually speak volumes about your health. In fact, some diseases can actually produce a unique, distinguishing odour, according to a recent Swedish study.So which funky fumes should you take note of? Here are five common body odours that might signal a serious problem and what you should do if the stench arises.Credit a complication of diabetes called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which occurs when your body runs low on insulin and your blood sugar spikes, says diabetes specialist Dr Robert Gabbay.People with type 1 diabetes generally experience it more than those with type 2 diabetes do.Here s what s happening: Your body can t create the energy it needs to function properly, so it begins to break down fatty acids for fuel.This creates a build up of acidic chemicals called ketones in your blood. One of the main acids acetone (the same component found in nail polish remover) can leave a fruity smell on your breath, Gabbay says.You might not notice it until someone else mentions it, but doctors can smell it on you as soon as you walk into their surgery.The effects of DKA can be serious even deadly. It can make you vomit and urinate frequently, causing your body to lose fluids at a dangerous rate, he says.DKA generally occurs with other symptoms of diabetes, like fatigue, blurred vision and unexplained weight loss, but in many cases, people don t put them all together, which delays diagnosis and treatment.So if you notice the fruity odour on your breath along with any of those symptoms especially if they are accompanied by fatigue, dry mouth, difficulty breathing or abdominal pain head to the emergency room as soon as possible.After your doctor tests your blood for ketones, he or she will work on replacing lost fluids and getting your sugar levels back to normal with insulin treatment.&nbsp;
