Following the deaths of gospel legends Sfiso Ncwane and Lundi Tyamara, some people have apparently been saying the gospel music industry is cursed. After Tyamara s funeral, a journalist asked gospel legend Rebecca Malope why she thought this was happening.In a video that has been circulating on social media, it was as if Malope was given a pulpit to preach.She looked at the journalist and said: It s not a curse, it s just a test. Hallelujah! She then took a step back and repeated: It s not a curse, it s a test. So to those who thought the gospel music industry was cursed, now you really know what s happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;
