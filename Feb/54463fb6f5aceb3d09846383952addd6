The South African government has reportedly distanced itself from Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema&#8217;s recent attack on President Robert Mugabe.According to the Zimbabwean state-owned Herald newspaper, South Africa s ambassador to Zimbabwe, Mphakama Mbete, said Malema&#8217;s utterance against Mugabe were not &#8220;in line with the policies and approaches of the South African government to Zimbabwe, SADC and the entire African continent&#8221;. Malema recently made headlines with his &#8220;grandpa it&#8217;s enough&#8221; comments, in which he called on Mugabe, 92, to step down.Mugabe has been in power since 1980 when the southern African country attained its independence from colonial Britain. Malema said Mugabe was &#8220;incapable of discharging his duties&#8221; and called on members of the ruling Zanu-PF party to be brave enoughh to tell the nonagenarian to go. &#8220;Zimbabwe&#8217;s situation is bad. President Mugabe cannot even control a spade We are not going to be good friends if we don&#8217;t tell them that what they are doing is not good for Zimbabwe s people,&#8221; Malema said during a press conference. But Mbete reassured the Zimbabwean government that Malema&#8217;s comments were his personal views and that this would not affect the cordial relations between the two countries.
