The star shared her thoughts on Valentine&#8217;s Day with fans through a lengthy blog post.Pearl surprised us when she revealed that she&#8217;s not actually a big fan of roses on Valentine&#8217;s. Like, for real.&#8220;I don t even like roses. No one should be giving me dead bodies as a gift, no matter how pretty they look. Give me a plant with roots and soil and stuff.&#8220;I won t say no to roses or any other flower, they re beautiful, but please don t assume I should be extremely excited. I just think, &#8216;congratulations, you just played yourself. You wasted money!&#8217; The thought still counts though,&#8221; Pearl wrote.She said that Valentine&#8217;s Day was always stressful but that she was &#8220;calmer about it now&#8221;.She also encouraged ladies to break with tradition and &#8220;do something insane&#8221; for their men on the day.&#8220;Get him that latest PlayStation, listen to the frivolous needs of your man as well. When I say be &#8216;grand&#8217;, I mean be spectacular- but even and more particularly with the little things. Iron his shirt that morning even if you re not that kinda girl (note- but don t burn it honey). Just go out of your way.&#8220;The truth is- while chivalry will always be welcomed, if we hope gender equality will be achieved, we must also level the playing field on these days,&#8221; Pearl added.So, diamonds for Valentine&#8217;s then, Pearl?&nbsp;
