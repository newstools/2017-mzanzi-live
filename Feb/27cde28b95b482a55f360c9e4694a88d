Girls, the minute you announce your relationship to the world, you ll start getting different reactions from everybody around you. Some of your friends will act like they re even happier than you about it, some will act quite indifferent, and then there will be a handful of girlfriends who just won t be able to cover up their jealousy no matter how hard they try.Now, we re not saying that this jealousy will necessarily be the result of how amazing your man is or how badly they want to steal him from you.No! It just might be a jealousy they feel from this new person in your life, this person who they fear will become more important than them one day.But no matter what their reason is, you should be careful of the following types of envious friends if you want a chance at making your relationship work:It s not been long since you and your guy started dating but you plan to introduce him to this one amazing friend of yours, the one who knows you inside out and the one who s seen it all with you from the very beginning.But this is exactly what turns the night into a complete disaster. Your friend can t stop recalling all the embarrassing stories she knows of you, that one psychotic moment you still regret where you had the biggest fight with her and that time you felt so dumb because you failed two courses even though you tried so hard.The stories just didn t seem to stop. You re not a person who can t laugh at her own self but something about your friend s tone, something about the look on her face makes you feel like she isn t doing this just for the fun.&nbsp;
