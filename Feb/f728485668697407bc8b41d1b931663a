It is reported that controversial politician and EFF leader Julius Malema has done perhaps one of the most awkward move in his career when he erected an iron statue of his former boss and long term rival Jacob Zuma.The statue is 1,5 metres tall, and is endowed with a big manhood. It was molded by iron. It is reported that the statue was erected on 14 February 2017. The move is seen as a symbol&#8217;s unquenched desire for women and his ties with the wealthy Gupta family. He is a polygamist and is believed to have not less than 22 children. Malema is considered the king maker of current president Zuma, when he mobilised party structures to revolt against former president Thabo Mbeki inorder to install Zuma. However things changed fast after Malema was seen to bee more of a burden than an asset in the party. He was expelled and formed his political formation to fight Zuma and his ANC.&nbsp;
