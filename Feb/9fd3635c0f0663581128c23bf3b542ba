We women always seem lost; this question has had women inquisitive since ages. We all want to know all the things we do, that drive our men crazy. We would give an arm and a leg to keep our men glued to us. All men are different and I am sure all you ladies have that one special quality, which makes your man drool over you.Here is a list of things I put together specially for you! There are a lot of things except good looks that men find appealing.Men love it when we go bare without makeup. Some of us women love makeup so much, I know I do! My husband says, when you take your makeup off it s like I am with a new woman with all of this bare raw, natural beauty, very sexy! They love it when we play hard to get, men are predators by instinct they love it when we make things intense by keeping our distance. They love it when we work out in front of them. Men love it when we are determined and work hard to achieve something we have our heart set on. There is nothing sexier than a strong woman. When we kiss them while staring into their eyes, there is something extremely attractive about this! When we write something on our wrist, it doesn t have to be a tattoo something written with a pen will do too! I write my husband s name on my wrist sometimes and it really turns him on!&nbsp;
