In these tough economic times, it s hard to please our loved ones, more especially on Valentine s Day.We have to spoil those we love with all sorts of sweet things, from chocolates to marshmallows. Otherwise, you stand a chance to be dumped for someone who drives a vrrr phaaa Volkswagen Golf GTI and hands out roses like Don Juan.On yesterday s day of love, one man in an EFF T-shirt was caught allegedly stealing chocolates at a Pick n Pay Express store.In pictures circulating on social media, the man was seen being handcuffed by security personnel at what appears to be a filling station.It s not clear when the incident took place, but the man received some unexpected support from Black First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama.Mngxitama says he believes in affirmative shopping by darkies , which sounds like just another way of saying that, if you re black, feel free to steal from white-owned shops as much as you like. Here we can see one can t love without sorting out LAND FIRST! Yesterday chocolate was the item that disappeared the most from shelves. Let s get the land back first and all shall follow! said the BLF leader on Facebook in reaction to the picture.Fellow expelled EFF member Lufuno Gogoro also commented. He said that, instead of fighting land thieves , they are busy stealing chocolates . While we busy fighting Land thieves they are busy stealing chocolates. I mean once we get back our land we will produce our own chocolate these Chocolate thieves, said Gogoro.
