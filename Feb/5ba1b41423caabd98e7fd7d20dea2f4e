In a black magic case, a Pretoria man died of a persistent erection after bonking a married woman. It is reported that the man had a one night stand with a married woman from the same neighbourhood.The fun did not have a happy ending as &#8216;s manhood remained erect for 5 days before he died. He received medical assistance from Netcare Pretoria East Hospital Hospital but the condition did not improve.The man was reportedly found dead with his penis still erect.The married dad-of-three, said to be in his late 30s and named only as Dumisani, was discovered in a hotel room having earlier boasted in a bar of his plans to impress his new lover. He was in pain, and the hotel attendants called an ambulance to take him to hospital.A friend of Dumisani was quoted as saying: &#8220;After having intercourse for a long time, he could not climax and must have died from the stress of the consistent hardness.&#8221;The doctors reported that the case could not have a proper medical explanation and the cause was new and strange to the medical profession.
