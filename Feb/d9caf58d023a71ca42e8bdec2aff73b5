Jele had to don the gloves and mind the posts when Jackson Mabokgwane was sent off during the Buccaneers 2-1 defeat to Bidvest Wits.Khune started off by praising Jele s skill. I am impressed by Happy Jele s skills as a keeper, he tweeted.He then followed it up with: Jele has taken over as SA s No.1 I m impressed. Go for a clean sheet bro. But it was when he suggested that Jele was a better keeper than some that caused a storm on social networks. Jele makes a better keeper than most of us. Bafana needs you bro, he said. Some took this as a jibe at other keepers who have failed to dethrone him as the country s No.1.Khune later clarified that he was not mocking Pirates, but rather admiring Jele. Some people think that I m mocking Pirates but all I m doing is admiring a great job from their longest serving player.
