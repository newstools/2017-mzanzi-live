Afro-Pop singing sensation Kelly Khumalo s life is currently on a high: her new album, My Truth, is getting major airplay on radio stations and she s bagging gigs left, right and centerThe star is in her element and it seems part of the reason Kelly is so happy is because she apparently has a new bae, Marvin Cohen. He s the producer of SABC1 s music show Live Amp.They ve apparently been dating for a couple of months but haven t gone public with the relationship. Kelly and Marvin are so in love, and they have been for a while. Initially people thought she was dating his friend, producer and voiceover artist Wenzile Dlamini (known popularly as Sjulad), but that s not the case. Kelly is dating Marvin, a source close to the pair reveals.There are also reports that Marvin is currently working on some project with the mother-of-two and that is how their romance started. Kelly has had a lot of public relationships and she is trying to keep this one from the media. So far she has been doing well at it, I am surprised that some people know of it, another source tells us.When we contacted Kelly s manager, Linda Moeketsi, on the singers new bae, he refuted claims. Those are just rumours, there is no truth to that. Kelly is single and focusing on her career, Linda insisted.Only time will tell fact from fiction.
