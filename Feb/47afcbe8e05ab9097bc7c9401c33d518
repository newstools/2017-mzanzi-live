Phumzile Thobejane left his mother, Mumsy Mmaboko, furious after he gave all the money his parents had saved up for his education to his local church, Mount Zion Bible Church.Thobejane completed matric last year, and his mother gave him the R50 000 the parents have been saving since 2003 so he could study at Jeppe College in Polokwane. Instead, he decided to listen to God s instruction and gave the money to his church, reports The Sowetan.Church leader Henry Mampa told the publication that he used the money to buy bags of cement to build the church and also bought musical instruments including speakers, drums and microphones.He further told Sowetan that he saw nothing wrong with what Thobejane did, as he gave the money voluntarily. Asked why he he did not consult Thobejane s parents, as he knew he was not working, the pastor said he did not question God s instruction to his people to give money to the church. He said he believed the money was a blessing from God.Mmaboko has demanded that the pastor return the money or everything he bought with it, as there was no money left to send her son to college.Thobejane said he did not regret what he did because as a Christian I go by faith and believe that God will give me more one day .
