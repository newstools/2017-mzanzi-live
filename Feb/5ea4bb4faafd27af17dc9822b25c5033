Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema on Thursday vowed that he would not approach the courts after members of his political party were forcefully removed from the joint sitting of Parliament for President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation address. This is a political battle. We will fight it on the ground. No, we will not be going to court, Malema said, addressing local and international journalists outside Parliament on Thursday night. I am injured, I m not sure how I can be able to hold the pen tomorrow. Our people are injured, Malema said shortly after violence erupted in the National Assembly when Parliament s protection services were ordered to remove Malema.Malema is scheduled to write an exam on Friday morning.
